            This product is amazing! I have finally found a moisturizer that actually works. I have very dry skin year round and nothing until this product has given me enough hydration. I was having trouble with my skin being so dry, any product I put on my face would burn so I went and got a sample of this and within a few days my skin felt so much better, I went and purchased the full size. It doesn't feel heavy at all and a little goes a long way.  I will be a staple in my skincare routine from now on.
